## ‚úÖ Checklist (check in order)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify Developer Mode**

**On printer's touchscreen:**
1. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Network** ‚Üí **LAN Only Mode** (or **Developer Mode**)
2. Make sure the toggle is **ENABLED** (green)
3. Write down the **Access Code** (8 digits) - it's permanent, doesn't change

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: 
- After enabling developer mode, **reboot the printer** (power off and on)
- Access Code must be **exactly 8 digits**
- Case sensitive? **NO** - numbers only

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify IP Address**

**On printer's touchscreen:**
1. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Network** ‚Üí **Network Information**
2. Find the **IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. Ensure IP address starts with the same subnet as your PC

**Test printer accessibility:**
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell or CMD)
ping 192.168.1.100

# You should get responses:
# Reply from 192.168.1.100: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=64
```

‚ùå **If ping fails:**
- Printer and PC are on different networks
- Router is blocking connections
- Wrong IP address

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Verify Serial Number**

**Serial number format**: `01P00A123456789` (15 characters)

**Where to find:**
- On **label** on printer body
- In **Bambu Handy** app: Settings ‚Üí About Printer
- On **touchscreen**: Settings ‚Üí About Printer

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: 
- Serial number must be **exact**
- Check for extra spaces at beginning/end
- Case matters: `01P00A` (uppercase letters)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Firewall**

Bambu Lab uses **port 8883** for MQTT connection.

**Windows:**
1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall**
2. Go to: **Advanced settings** ‚Üí **Outbound Rules**
3. Find **3D Printer Control Panel** application
4. Ensure it's **allowed**

**Or create rule manually:**
```
Port: 8883
Protocol: TCP
Direction: Outbound
Action: Allow
```

**Quick test** (temporarily disable firewall):
- **NOT RECOMMENDED** for permanent use
- For diagnostics only

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Test MQTT Connection**

**Use MQTT Explorer** (free tool):
1. Download: [mqtt-explorer.com](http://mqtt-explorer.com/)
2. Configure connection:
   - **Protocol**: `mqtts://`
   - **Host**: Your printer's IP
   - **Port**: `8883`
   - **Username**: `bblp`
   - **Password**: Your Access Code
   - **SSL/TLS**: Enabled, but without certificate verification
3. Click **Connect**

‚úÖ **If it connects** - issue is in the app (restart app)  
‚ùå **If it doesn't connect** - issue is in printer settings or network

## üîç Common Issues

### ‚ùå "Connection timeout - exceeded connection timeout"

**Causes:**
1. Printer is off or sleeping
2. Wrong IP address
3. Firewall blocking port 8883
4. Printer and PC on different subnets

**Solution:**
- Check printer is **powered on** and not in sleep mode
- Verify IP address (may change after router reboot)
- Temporarily disable firewall for testing
- Use **static IP** for printer in router settings

### ‚ùå "Printer unavailable. Check IP address"

**Causes:**
1. Wrong IP address
2. Printer changed IP (DHCP)
3. Printer is off

**Solution:**
- Check IP address on printer screen
- Set up **static IP** in router
- Ensure printer is powered on

### ‚ùå "Invalid Access Code"

**Causes:**
1. Code written incorrectly
2. Developer mode was toggled off and on (code might have changed)
3. Extra spaces when entering

**Solution:**
- Check code on printer screen again
- Copy code **without spaces**
- Try disabling and enabling developer mode again

### ‚ùå "Not authorized" or authorization errors

**Causes:**
1. Developer mode is **disabled**
2. Wrong Access Code
3. Printer wasn't rebooted after enabling developer mode

**Solution:**
1. Verify developer mode is **enabled**
2. **Reboot printer** (power off and on)
3. Check Access Code
4. Wait 30-60 seconds after powering on printer

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Diagnostics

If printer still won't connect, perform these steps **in order**:

### Step 1: Full Reboot
1. **Close** 3D Printer Control Panel app
2. **Power off** printer (unplug)
3. Wait **30 seconds**
4. **Power on** printer
5. Wait for full boot (screen ready)
6. **Launch** app again

### Step 2: Verify Developer Mode
1. On printer screen: **Settings** ‚Üí **Network** ‚Üí **Developer Mode**
2. If **disabled** - enable it
3. **Reboot printer** again
4. Write down **Access Code**

### Step 3: Ping Test
```bash
ping <printer_IP> -t
```
Should get responses. If not - network issue.

### Step 4: Check Port 8883
**Windows:**
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <printer_IP> -Port 8883
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
nc -zv <printer_IP> 8883
```

If port is **closed** or **filtered** - firewall or router issue.

### Step 5: Recreate Printer in App
1. **Delete** printer from app
2. **Restart** app
3. **Add** printer again with correct data:
   - Type: **Bambu Lab**
   - IP: Verified IP
   - Access Code: Verified code (8 digits)
   - Serial Number: Exact serial number

## üåê Network Settings

### Recommended Configuration

#### 1. Static IP for Printer
Set up **DHCP Reservation** in router:
- Bind printer's MAC address to permanent IP
- IP won't change after reboot

#### 2. Firewall Setup
Create exception for:
- **Application**: `3D Printer Control Panel.exe`
- **Port**: `8883`
- **Protocol**: `TCP`
- **Direction**: Outbound

#### 3. Router
Some routers have AP Isolation protection:
- Ensure **AP Isolation is disabled**
- Check **Guest Network** - printer shouldn't be on guest network

## üìä Logs and Diagnostics

### View Logs in App
1. Open **3D Printer Control Panel**
2. Click **"üìã Event Log"** button at bottom
3. Find connection error messages
4. Copy error text for analysis

### Typical Error Messages

#### ‚úÖ Successful connection:
```

```
**Solution**: Check IP and if printer is on

#### ‚ùå Authorization error:
```
‚ùå Invalid Access Code. Check code in printer settings.
