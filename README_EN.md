## 👥 Who Is This For?

### 🎯 Target Audience

**Primarily for 3D farm operators, secondarily for their managers.**

### 🚨 Main Purpose

**To alert operators in time when a specific printer requires attention.**

Critical events requiring immediate response:
- 🔴 **Error** - printer stopped with error
- ⏸️ **Pause** - print paused
- 🏁 **Print Complete** - model ready, need to remove and start next print

### 📺 Display Mode

The program is **ideally suited for display on a large monitor or TV** in production environment:
- ✅ Large interface elements visible from distance
- ✅ Color coding - instant status recognition
- ✅ Dynamic sorting - important always on top
- ✅ Responsive design - works on any resolution

> **"Keep operators alert"** - Windows XP sound plays on events (error/pause/complete).  
> *(Sound looping was considered a bad idea and is not implemented)*

### 🎯 Smart Card Sorting

**Dynamic printer card ordering is not random:**

The closer to a problem and need for attention - the higher the priority and position in queue.

#### Priorities (from highest to lowest):
1. 🔴 **Error** - requires immediate attention
2. ⏸️ **Pause** - printer waiting for action
3. 🏁 **Complete** - need to remove model
4. 🟢 **Printing 95-100%** - **automatically moves up!**
5. 🟡 **Ready** - waiting for job
6. 🟢 **Printing** - working normally
7. ⚫ **Offline** - doesn't interfere, at bottom

> **Key feature:** When approaching print completion (95-100%), the card **automatically moves higher** in the list so the operator can prepare for model change.

### 📏 Interface Scalability

**If all printer cards don't fit on monitor - that's okay!**

- Print percentages are **intentionally enlarged** for distance visibility
- Critical printers always on top and visible
- Can scroll list to view all printers
- Printers requiring attention always visible without scrolling

### 💡 Work Concept

1. **Operator sees large screen** with control panel
2. **Printers working** - cards green, bottom of list
3. **Printer approaching completion** - card moves up
4. **Print completed** - card on top, blinking red, **sound alert**
5. **Operator responds** - removes model, starts next print
6. **Cycle repeats** for maximum farm efficiency

## 📋 Adding Printers

### For Klipper Printers:
1. ➕ Click "Add Printer"
2. 📝 Select "Klipper" type and fill in data:
   - **🏷️ Name** - any printer name
   - **🌐 IP address** - local printer IP on network
   - **🔌 Moonraker port** - usually `7125`
   - **🖥️ Web interface port** - usually `80` or `4408`/`4409`

### Temperature Sensor Configuration (Klipper):
After adding a printer, click the **🌡️** button on the printer card to configure temperature sensor display.

**Two operating modes:**
- **Simple (default)** - automatic chamber detection, no setup needed
- **Advanced** - select specific sensors and give them custom names

### For Bambu Lab Printers:

## 🎯 System Features

### 🎯 Status Priorities (smart dynamic sorting)

The closer to a problem and need for attention - the higher the priority:

1. 🔴 **Error** - critical problem, requires immediate attention
2. ⏸️ **Pause** - printer stopped, needs action
3. 🏁 **Complete** - model ready, need to remove and start next print
4. 🟢 **Printing 95-100%** - **automatically moves up!** Operator prepares for change
5. 🟡 **Ready** - waiting for job
6. 🟢 **Printing** - working normally
7. ⚫ **Offline** - doesn't interfere, at bottom

> **Important:** If cards don't fit on monitor - no problem! When approaching completion (95-100%), the card **automatically moves higher** in the list, and the operator will always see printers requiring attention.

### 🌡️ Visual Temperature Warnings
- **🔥 Nozzle > 170°C** - red color (hot surface!)
- **🔥 MCU > 60°C** - red color + enlarged font x2 (critical overheating!)
- Automatic detection of MCU/Board/Mainboard sensors

### 🔊 Sound Alerts
- **Windows XP sound** plays on critical events:
  - 🏁 Print complete
  - ⏸️ Pause
  - 🔴 Error
- Plays **3 times** to attract attention
- Looping was considered a bad idea and is not implemented

### 🧠 Smart Status Detection
System analyzes multiple data sources for accurate state determination:
- `print_stats.state`
- `virtual_sdcard.is_active` 
- `display_status.progress`
- 📁 Print activity by file name
